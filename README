The ideal metaprogramming framework is an experiment and a work in progress.

Features are missing and not yet implemented; there is no documentation
to speak of.

The code is in half-bootstrapped form: the library and the runtime are
written in a custom notation, while translator is written in Java.

You can't do anything useful with it, yet.  To track the developments
and be notified when the project will reach a more mature state, subscribe to

If you want to dive into the code anyway, start with
